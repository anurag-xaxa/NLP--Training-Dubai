                <h2 style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>What is NLP?</h2>
                <p>NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) was created in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. NLP is a set of tools for personal change and development which offers powerful ways to create goals, reach them faster and with greater ease, resolve work or personal issues, reduce stress, and manage change. NLP offers practical skills to better understand yourself and others, be happier in your life, and to achieve your goals and dreams.</p>
                <p>Neuro Linguistic Programming studies the ways our thoughts affect our behaviour. It looks at the ways our brains interpret the signals they receive and how these interpretations affect what we do. It does this through language, the linguistic part of Neuro Linguistic Programming techniques. By examining how our brains process information, NLP techniques help us to look at our thoughts, feelings, and emotions as things that we can control, rather than things that passively happen to us.</p>
                <p>NLP can benefit anyone who is interested in personal growth &#8211; a powerful human need that can bring fulfilment to our lives. NLP techniques are particularly useful for building skills like public speaking, sales and negotiation, team building and leadership. Its action-oriented nature and focus on growth mean that NLP and coaching go hand in hand. Many coaches use NLP techniques to help their clients reprogram their brains and achieve their goals.</p>
                <p>NLP techniques are action oriented. Rather than focusing on the why, as you might do in therapy, NLP focuses on the how. How can you react differently to your thoughts and emotions? How can you adapt your communication style to the situation? How can you change your mindset so that life is happening for you, not to you? Most of all, NLP believes in a growth mindset. It’s a behavioural method that uses the power of reframing to help people overcome their limiting beliefs and create a breakthrough in your own life.</p>
